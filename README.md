# DPGraph: A Benchmark Platform for Differentially Private Graph Analysis

DPGraph is a web-based platform to benchmark differentially private algorithms for graph analysis. The goal of DPGraph is to provide an open-source and extendable framework for researchers and practitioners to evaluate existing algorithms for their privacy, accuracy, and efficiency, thus allowing them to discover the state-of-the-art for their applications. This framework also allows researchers to test their new algorithms against existing ones with ease. This repository implements a suite of DP algorithms and contains scripts to evaluate the algorithms over a wide range of graph datasets and privacy budgets.
