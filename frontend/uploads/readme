This is where the new_algorithm.py will be stored.

Make sure have a folder called Datasets exactly the same as the Dataset in the DPGraph folder that contains the raw data of the datasets which you can find in https://github.com/heqianjane88/DPGraph.

Make sure create_new.sh and create_newedge.sh is executable. Those are the files that will actually execute the user's uploaded algorithm and dis play the result in the php page. 

Loading the php file on the web page may take long depending on the new_algorithm you wrote, it should display the result as soon as all the code are done running. Please make sure the file you upload have the same template as the one in the uploading.html

Please make sure that when you are opening the php or html files, they are opened theough a live server. More deatils are in the readme.txt in the frontend folder. 

algo.py and edgealgo.py will print the unmodified data of the noisy histogram and it will go through the clear, noisycdf and modify_noisy that actually produced the data needed to produce the histogram and cdf figure. 

Note that the algo.py and edgealgo.py are the files that modified from evalDegDist.py from the DPGraph folder. 

evalDegDist.py and evalDegDistedge.py will print the unmodified data and it will go through clear that actually produced the data needed to plot the frontier plot. 

Note that the evalDegDist.py and evalDegDistedge.py are the files that modified from evalDegDist.py from the DPGraph folder.
