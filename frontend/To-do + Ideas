1. Some algorithms seem to have very long names. "The data point being displayed is algorithm: nodeDP_edgeAdd_degCum_Lap_variant ,and the epsilon chosen is 0.02"
    - Karl fixed this part. Remember to put this into interface.

6. There should more explanation of what the "animate" button is doing. I got confused of what it is doing when I am trying it.

7. Need a story for the usage scenarios.
    - Things that we can showcase: 
      1) Choose between different parameters, then show how the "animate" button works (as well as explaining what it does)
      2) "Upload" your own algorithm (this should be an interesting thing to demo)

10. For subgraph counting, we are not using "blue" graph to represent the true count, but rather the "purple" graph.

12. (SC) One things I am noticing is that when we clicked on a point from the Ladder line, which is blue, noisy hist shows up as blue. But once we click on animate, 
    it turns to orange.

13. Currently, there is nothing to show for the empirical findings tab.
    - If yes, we need to think about which content we should put in it, and how we want to display it. (which can make up for another
      section in the demo video/usage scenario I think).
