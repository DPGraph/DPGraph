To test the website locally, simply clone this repo, and open index.html (or any html file) in your browser. (Note that some browers may not be able to display the plots due to CORS. Microsoft Edge works.)

All CSV files are used for plots.

All code are written in the HTML files. All comments about the code are provided within the HTML files.

Currently, all interactions are written in "frontier.html". Check out frontier.html to see details of their implementation.
